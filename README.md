# RDBMS_Project

### Proposal
1.	We are interested in the ‘food’ topic, especially for restaurants in Hyehwa. Our target users are students, especially SKKU students who want to know about delicious restaurants. 
2.	We can get the data from this website . For each restaurant, we are going to scrape the data from the ‘Naver Map’ website to get the review texts. For about 500 ~ 600 restaurants or cafes, we would get more than 5,000 reviews. 
3.	Csv files.
4.	We have to clean the scraped data first because some restaurants could have been closed or don’t have enough information. Then, we would make 4 tables, one for the basic information of each restaurants like the name, location, and category (such as café, pub..). And other tables would contain reviews of each restaurant, scoring, and category information. 
5.	Recommendation of Hyehwa’s restaurants based on user preferences.
6.	For the next two weeks, we will collect data (by scraping) and convert them to csv files and create tables (develop DB) in MySQL. In the final step we are going to design the GUI and develop our application.
